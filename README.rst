Python Package Skeleton Template
================================

This is a **project skeleton template** for a **Python project/library**. The repository intents to implement and explain the latest best practices in team software development, continuous integration and deployment. The repository simulates the implementation of a :code:`sampleproject`.

You will find in the `project's documentation`_ all references that motivated the current configuration as well as detailed explanation on the different configuration files.

I intent to keep this repository up to date to my knowledge and needs. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated, please raise an `issue`_ and share your thoughts.

Motivation
==========

Understand and implement in the best practices in software development and deployment for scientific software; actually I think the strategy reviewed here can be applied at many other development contexts.

This repository does NOT intent to be a `cookiecutter`_-like repository. Thought there are many and very well documented cookiecutter templates out there, `even for scientific software`_, I felt that directly using a cookiecutter would lead me nowhere because I would miss the whole understanding of what the cookiecutter is automatizing in the first place. Therefore, building a repository from scratch was the only and best approach to achieve a minimum understanding of best practices and protocols.

Acknowledgments
===============

The whole repository structure and CI layout has strongly influenced by the discussions provided by `ionel`_ in his `blog post`_ about *Packaging a python library*. I really recommend reading through that post and the other related posts in his blog. Hence, `python-nameless`_ and `cookiecutter-pylibrary`_ are two repositories that served as main source of information for the *python-project-skeleton* repository; other sources of information were also important and those are referenced within context.
