Branch organization                                                             
-------------------                                                             
                                                                                
Two main branches set the development workflow: the `master branch`_ and the `latest branch`_. The latest branch is thought to evolve according to continuous integration practices, and is referred as the *latest* build or version; while, on the other hand, the *master branch* is considered the *stable* or *production* version. Under this configuration the *master* branch receives updates from the *latest* build periodically or when a new version/patch is ready for deployment. Read further about :ref:`Branch workflow`.
